# **Peeramid**

## Description

#### Peer evaluation platform

It allows teachers to publish evaluations for their students to acces them immediately and deliver them directly on
the platform. Teachers can also define correction terms of these evaluations.

Then, assignments delivered will be assigned to the students for them to correct them on the platform. After correcting
the assignments, students will be allowed to give their opinion about the corrections they received.

Teachers will then be able to access statistics relatives to each evaluation.
